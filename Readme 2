4. “What should be done for the actual money app?”

Here’s a simple roadmap for your Money Analyzer 🧩

4.1 Core Entities

User – login, profile

Account – bank/wallet/credit-card, balance

Category – “Food”, “Rent”, “Salary” (global + user custom)

Transaction – amount, type (INCOME/EXPENSE/TRANSFER), date, note, account, category

(Later) Budget, Goal, RecurringTransaction

4.2 Typical APIs

Auth

POST /api/auth/register

POST /api/auth/login

GET /api/auth/me

Accounts

GET /api/accounts – list all accounts of current user

POST /api/accounts – create new account

PUT/PATCH /api/accounts/{id} – rename/update

DELETE /api/accounts/{id} – delete (maybe soft delete)

Transactions

GET /api/transactions?from=...&to=...&accountId=...

POST /api/transactions – add expense/income/transfer

PUT/PATCH /api/transactions/{id}

DELETE /api/transactions/{id}

Categories

GET /api/categories – global + user-created

POST /api/categories – create custom category

Reports (later)

GET /api/reports/summary?month=2025-11

GET /api/reports/by-category?...

All of these (except /api/auth/**) should be JWT-protected using your existing SecurityConfig.

5. Putting it together – user flow

User calls POST /api/auth/register.

User calls POST /api/auth/login → gets JWT token.

Frontend/Postman sends:

Authorization: Bearer <token>


for every future request.

User calls POST /api/accounts to create “HDFC Savings”.

User calls POST /api/transactions to add expenses/income.

If you want, next step I can help you design the full Account entity + controller methods for your app based on what you already coded.
